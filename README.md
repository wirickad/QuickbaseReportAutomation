# QuickbaseReportAutomation
This is a repository used to get quickbase reports via the Quickbase API. This specific example allows you to then separate the report by grouping the data on the column of your choice. A dataframe is created for each group, and the data for each group is then saved to an output folder in both .xlsx and pdf format.
