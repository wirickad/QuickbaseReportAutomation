# QuickbaseReportAutomation
This is a repository used to get quickbase reports via the Quickbase API. This specific example allows you to then separate the report by grouping the data on the column of your choice. A dataframe is created for each group, and the data for each group is then saved to an output folder in both .xlsx and pdf format. 

You will need to first obtain an API token on Quickbase

You will also need to create a folder named 'output' in the same directory as main.py, this is where the .xlsx and pdf files will be stored
